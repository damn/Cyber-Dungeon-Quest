**Game Design Document Summary:**

# UnpredictaRPG: Bloodmoon Chronicles

## Concept:
A swift, intense journey through the supernatural realm with impactful decisions and unpredictable events. Drawing inspiration from the darkness of vampire lore, akin to the uncertainty of Diablo 2 but condensed into 20-30 minute cryptic sessions. Embracing circular development, where players navigate a world that challenges and mystifies, refusing conventional character progression.

## Gameplay:
- Quick, strategic decisions in a dark fantasy setting.
- Random events add an air of eerie unpredictability.
- Echoes of Diablo 2 in shorter, cryptic play sessions.
- Circular development ensures the haunting unknown.
- Build your vampiric legacy through diverse "deck" options.

## Future Plans:
Anticipate the unfolding of a strategic night, envisioning a fusion of Warcraft 3's tactics with the mystique of Magic or Warhammer. Initially, the solitary journey into the shadows—a challenging single-player experience—before delving into the complexities of nocturnal networked adventures.

*Awaken the Bloodmoon, where the undead dance in the shadows.*
