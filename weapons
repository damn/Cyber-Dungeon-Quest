BUg player attack skill not available

I want to browse player entity data simply not go through code etc ..
=> src/dev

=> on rightclick open that (dbg mode )


. Rename spells/foo to skills/foo ?, grep 'spells'

3. Add 'attack' skill, give to all creatures
  * uses entity stat actiontime, range, dmg

3.1 Add entity stat component (schema, editable in editor )

3.2 Add modifier to weapons action-time, dmg, range, sound which attack uses
  (can do later , player only, only +1 range staff is als ok .)

4. Rightclick entity stat / debug stat viewer tree window
  (remove entity info window )

5. Check hotkeys info / etc. is correct / in 1 place.

6. Rename target entity tx to tx/maxrange-ray-attack ?

* remove those keys from weapon
* & add entity stats attackspeed, range, ,dmg , attacksound
* add attack skill which uses those stats
* and in case of player weapons modify those stats
* (ranged later do )
* & remove inventory
* & weapons modify stats, express range, attackspeed, sound as modifyer
